# Stormwater Runoff (inch)
## Summary
<!-- Add a one or two sentence to describe this indicator -->
Stormwater runoff algorithm is based on empirical equations (ex.the curve number method), and fed by a series of raster data layers such as topography, land cover & management (detailed for regenerative practices), hydrologic soil groups, and a rainfall raster for a 24 hour, 10 year storm event (suggestion, to be discussed).  Final results are reported as: Runoff depth, in inches.
## Details
<!-- Add a more detailed description about this indicator -->
Reccomended raster resolution for the input layers is 10m for land cover (sentinel based), 30m for topography (new srtm layers), and 30m for hydrologiic soil groups (available for US, Puerto Rico and some other areas. When no such resolution is available, the 250m global HYSOG is recommended).
